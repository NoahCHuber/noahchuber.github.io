## Project description

The purpose of this project is to help students understand how to securely set up, configure, and observe Linux-based systems within a virtual machine environment. The project emphasizes system awareness, basic networking tools, and fundamental security practices. It introduces students to real-world cybersecurity tasks such as port scanning, service auditing, and firewall configuration. This project also introduces a security auditing tool called Lynis which is open-source and allows for a lightweight security audit report to check overall system security. 

## Project Walkthrough

VM Setup:
- Download and install VirtualBox or UTM.
- Set up a virtual machine and import an Ubuntu ISO.
- Take a screenshot of the setup for submission.

Ubuntu Installation:
- Install Ubuntu manually.
- Change the wallpaper and pin the terminal to the dock.
- Take a screenshot of the completed desktop setup.

Network Observation:
- Use terminal commands to view IP configurations and open ports.
- Install and use nmap to scan the local machine.
- Take a screenshot showing results of a scan.

Security Hardening:
- Update the system and review running services.
- Enable the UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall).
- Install and run a quick security audit using Lynis.

## GUI Design Walkthrough

**While the focus is on command-line interaction, these UI elements are part of the setup:**

- **VM Interface: VirtualBox “New Machine” creation and ISO import UI.**

- **Ubuntu Desktop: After installation, change the background image via Settings > Appearance.**

- **Terminal Pinning: Right-click Terminal and select “Pin to Dash.”**

- **Running Terminal Commands Using Bash: Follow the rest of the walkthrough guide and run bash commands in the terminal.**

## 3. Additional Considerations

**While this isn’t a coding-heavy project, it’s highly relevant to cybersecurity, system administration, and IT infrastructure:**

**1. Real-World Cyber Defense Skills**
This project mirrors tasks that professionals perform in entry-level cybersecurity, IT, and system admin roles. Setting up a VM, checking for open ports, enabling firewalls, and running security audits are fundamental defense practices used in corporate environments.

**2. Hands-On with Linux Environments**
Many production servers run Linux. Understanding how to navigate and secure a Linux system using terminal commands is a key skill for anyone entering the cybersecurity or DevOps fields. You’re not writing code—but you are working directly with system internals.

**3. Tool Familiarity Matters**
Tools like nmap, ufw, and Lynis are industry standards. Learning them in a sandboxed VM prepares students to use them in real-world environments, safely and confidently.

**4. Foundation for Automation Later**
Though the steps are manual now, they lay the groundwork for scripting and automation in the future (e.g., using bash, Python, or Ansible to automate scans, audits, or firewall setups). It’s a solid first step into security-focused programming.

**5. Emphasizes Security Mindset**
More than anything, this project helps develop a security-first mindset—observing what’s running, understanding what shouldn’t be, and taking steps to harden systems. These habits are essential for ethical hacking, red/blue team exercises, and secure development.
